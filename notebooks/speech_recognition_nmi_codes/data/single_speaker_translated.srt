1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Good morning. I'm Dr. Martin. What's your name?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Juan de la Cruz.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Juan de la Cruz. How old are you?

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm 30 years old.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What's the reason you went to the emergency room? What are you going to see?

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
My stomach hurts since this morning.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This morning? Okay. What did you eat last before your stomach hurt? What are you doing?

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Actually, last night, my friends and I drank.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
When I got home, I didn't eat anything.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
But when I woke up this morning, because of my hangover, I had coffee.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Okay. What did you drink last night?

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Hard liquor like vodka and tequila.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Okay. Can you estimate how many glasses or bottles you drank last night?

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:09,000
What I remember is we drank two shots of tequila and two shots of vodka.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Okay. But yesterday, you didn't feel anything? You didn't vomit?

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yesterday, I didn't feel anything. I went home and I didn't feel anything.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Okay. What time did you wake up earlier?

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Earlier, I woke up at 5 o'clock because of my hangover.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I decided to have coffee.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
After I had coffee, that's where my stomach hurt.

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Okay. It's now 8 o'clock.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Okay. So if it's 5 o'clock, it's been three hours since you started feeling it.

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Then you drank coffee.

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Okay. Which part of your stomach hurts?

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The part I feel the most is the upper part of my heart.

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The lower part?

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yes.

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Okay. If you were to give a score of how much it hurts, from 1 to 10, 10 is very painful, 5 is a bit, 0 is nothing.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
What is your pain score for now?

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
For now, 7 out of 10.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Ah, so it's really painful.

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Do you feel pain in the back or just in the middle? Just there in your stomach?

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It used to hurt in the back, but now it's more in the middle.

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Okay. Can you describe the pain? Is it painful? Is it like being stabbed? Is it like being beaten? What is the description of the pain?

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Now, it's like it's painful. It's like I want to puke and it hurts a bit.

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Then it goes on, right? It doesn't disappear, it comes back, right?

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yes.

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Okay. Aside from the pain of the stomach now, do you feel pain in the stomach? Is it hard to rest? Is it painful in the stomach? What do you feel?

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:17,000
There is no pain in the stomach, but it's like I'm catching my breath, it's like I'm choking.

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Okay.

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
But apart from that, there is no continued vomiting.

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
How is your pooping?

43
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:37,000
When I got home last night, I just pooped once, but this morning, there is still no chance of pooping.

44
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
But these past days, your poops are not black.

45
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What past days? I don't have any. My poop is normal.

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Your poop is normal?

47
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Yes.

48
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Okay. Are you sick?

49
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm sick, I don't have any.

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You don't have any? Okay. Aside from this, do you have any other diseases like high blood, diabetes?

51
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I don't have high blood or diabetes.

52
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Did you go to the hospital recently?

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I don't have any.

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Did you get operated?

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I don't have any.

56
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Do you have any allergies to food or medicine?

57
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I don't have any.

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Do you have a sore throat?

59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I don't have any.

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You don't have any.

61
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
But how is drinking alcohol? Do we drink a lot?

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:27,000
To be honest, almost every week, we go out with friends to drink.

63
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
This habit has been around for years.

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Okay. So how many times a week is this?

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
In one week, we go out almost every other day.

66
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
That's also the case with the consumption of alcohol.

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yes, that's where we play. Sometimes it's more, sometimes it's less. But that's the average.

68
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Okay.

69
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
This is just a standard question. Is the use of drugs prohibited?

70
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I haven't tried anything that prohibits drugs.

71
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Okay.

72
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Okay.

73
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
But in your family, how is it? Is there a type of high blood, diabetes?

74
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
On my father's website, there's a history of high blood.

75
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
On my mother's website, it's diabetes.

76
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Okay.

77
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Okay.

78
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So for now, we're going to examine you.

79
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'll get your vital signs. We'll just repeat it.

80
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Okay.

81
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So your BP right now, let's just check.

82
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So it's 120 over 80, sir. So your BP is normal.

83
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Your heart rate is 80 beats per minute.

84
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Then your respiratory rate is at 18 cycles per minute, which is normal.

85
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Your temperature is 36.5, which is normal. You don't have a fever right now.

86
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Your level of oxygen is also good at 98%.

87
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Okay.

88
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Okay.

89
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'll just examine you, sir.

90
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Okay.

91
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'll just look at your eyes. They're not bluish.

92
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
They're not pale either.

93
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So you have anectaric sclera, pink palpebral conjunctiva,

94
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
no nasooral discharge,

95
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
no neck vein distension,

96
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
no anterior neck mass,

97
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
no perioral,

98
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
no ulitions,

99
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
no tonsiloparyngeal congestion.

100
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Okay. Moving on.

101
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'll just examine your chest.

102
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Symmetrical chest expansion, clear breath sounds,

103
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
no wheeze, no crackles,

104
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
normal rate, regular rhythm, no murmur,

105
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
soft, flat abdomen,

106
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
with minimal tenderness and epigastric area.

107
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And then full equal pulses with CRT of less than two seconds.

108
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Okay.

109
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Now for my current assessment as acid peptic disease,

110
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
rollout acute pancreatitis.

111
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Now for our plan, I'll be inserting an IV axis,

112
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
gauge 20,

113
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:24,000
and then I will hook my patient to a plain NSS at 80 cc per hour.

114
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
We'll give padtoprazole 40-milligram IV now.

115
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And then I will be requesting for the following diagnostics,

116
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,000
CBC, urinalysis, serum lipase.

117
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And then I will place my patient on NPO.

118
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Okay.

119
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And then we'll observe the patient, monitor the vital signs every hour,

120
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
and for serial abdominal exam.

121
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Okay, sir.

122
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So, we'll give you the medicines,

123
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
we'll give you the IV,

124
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
and then we'll observe you now.

125
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Don't eat too much.

126
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Thank you, sir.

127
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Thank you, sir.

128
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Thank you, though.
